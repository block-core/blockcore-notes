      <p>
        Photos and films are only displayed for accounts you are following. This is for your protection and ensures you're not downloading images you don't want to see, but also don't want to download as anyone can link to very large
        images.
      </p>
      <p>Not loading photos is also a measure to improve your privacy. When photos are displayed, your IP-address is available to the server hosting the photo.</p>

        <mat-panel-description>Unwanted content</mat-panel-description>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>It is easy to be exposed to unwanted content on Nostr, as there are a public feed available that contains everything that everyone is posting.</p>
      <p>The best way to ensure you don't get wanted content, is to follow users you know and trust. Only use the Home Feed and People/Circle sections.</p>
